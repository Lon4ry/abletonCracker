# What is this?
This is an open-source implementation of the R2R Patch and `R2RLIVE.dll` of Ableton Live, written in Python 3.

Like `R2RLIVE.dll`, this script uses Team R2R's signing key only.

# Disclaimer
This script is not the result of reverse engineering Ableton Live, and the output of this script **will not** circumvent the protection on an **unmodified** copy of Ableton Live.
# Download
Download the source code zip file from Releases tab. Otherwise features could be broken.

# How to use
1. Open `config.json`
2. Change the variables to fit your Ableton Live installation.
3. Save the file.
4. Run `activate_ableton.py`, your Ableton should be patched and the `Authorize.auz` file should generate.
